I am a **3rd** year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (**UIUC**), where I work with Prof. [**Aishwarya Ganesan**](https://aishwaryaganesan.github.io/) and Prof. [**Ramnatthan Alagappan**](https://ramalagappan.github.io/) in the [**DASSL Lab**](https://dassl-uiuc.github.io/). My research interests lie in **Dissaggregated Memeory** and **Distributed Storage Systems**.

âœ¨ What Iâ€™ve been up to lately

<!-- - Built **UniCache**, a smart caching layer that cuts down redundancy in replicated storage using something called **Replication-Aware Caching (RAC)** â€” because nobody likes duplicate data everywhere. -->
<!-- - Helped design a system to provide **cache-coherent access** to coarse-grained objects on a rack-scale CXL pod (shared) with limited hardware coherence. â€” basically making memory sharing across the rack less of a headache. -->
- Currently hacking away on a **fault-tolerant Linux page cache** that pulls in underused memory from across the datacenter. Itâ€™s like page caching, but supercharged.
- Playing around with **learned indexes** to make memory access and data placement faster and more efficient in disaggregated memory setups.
- Teaming up with folks at **ARCANA Research Group** to cook up a **clustering-based caching algorithm** that finds hidden memory access patterns most people miss.


Before joining UIUC, I spent **3.5 years at VMware R&D** as a Kernel Developer on the **Core Storage team**, where I worked on NVMe, iSCSI, and vSCSI components inside the ESXi kernel.

I also interned at **Carnegie Mellon University**, where I built a kernel-aware MMU page prefetcher for improving real-time memory locality.
