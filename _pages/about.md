I am a **2nd** year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (**UIUC**), where I work with Prof. [**Aishwarya Ganesan**](https://aishwaryaganesan.github.io/) and Prof. [**Ramnatthan Alagappan**](https://ramalagappan.github.io/) in the [**DASSL Lab**](https://dassl-uiuc.github.io/). My research interests lie in **Dissaggregated Memeory** and **Distributed Storage Systems**.

Before joining UIUC, I spent **3.5 years at VMware R&D** as a Kernel Developer on the **Core Storage team**, where I worked on NVMe, iSCSI, and vSCSI components inside the ESXi kernel.

I also interned at **Carnegie Mellon University**, where I built a kernel-aware MMU page prefetcher for improving real-time memory locality.
